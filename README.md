Linear Algebra Library for Game Development

LinearAlgebra4Games - Lightweight Linear Algebra Library for Video Games and Computer Graphics (Under Development)

Overview:
LinearAlgebra4Games is an ongoing C++ library project tailored for video game developers and computer graphics enthusiasts. It aims to provide a comprehensive set of linear algebra functionalities optimized for real-time applications, offering a solid foundation for creating immersive gaming experiences and visually stunning graphics.

Key Features:

Vector and Matrix Operations: Perform essential vector and matrix operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, dot product, cross product, and more, with a focus on efficiency and performance.

Transformations: Implement common transformations like translation, rotation, scaling, and shearing to manipulate objects in 2D and 3D spaces efficiently.

Quaternions: Plan to incorporate quaternion operations to simplify complex rotations and avoid gimbal lock issues, crucial for smooth camera movement and orientation in 3D environments.

Interpolation: Include interpolation methods like linear, cubic, and spherical interpolation for smooth transitions and animations.

Projection and View Matrices: Intend to provide projection and view matrices for various types of cameras, such as perspective and orthographic, for realistic rendering and scene visualization.

Collision Detection: Plan to implement collision detection and response algorithms to facilitate game development needs.

Note: This library is currently under active development. It is not yet feature-complete, and the API may undergo significant changes as development progresses.Feedback and contributions are highly appreciated to help shape the library's future.
